# GenAI for Developers

# Course Content

## Overview

This course provides a deep dive into Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, covering essential concepts, frameworks, and advanced applications. Participants will learn how to build AI-powered applications, optimize workflows, and implement security best practices in AI-driven systems.

Since this a practical, project focused course, we are not going to focus on math part rather our goal is to use AI tech stack to build application/products. 

## What You Will Learn

- **Introduction to LLM and Generative AI** – Understanding the fundamentals of LLMs and their capabilities.
- **AI Agents and Agentic Workflows** – Implementing intelligent, autonomous AI agents.
- **Building Basic Chat Applications** – Using LangChain to develop AI-driven chatbots.
- **Chat Over Large Documents** – Leveraging vector stores such as Qdrant DB, PG Vector, and Pinecone for efficient document retrieval.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Enhancing AI responses with dynamic information retrieval.
- **Context-Aware AI Applications** – Developing AI solutions that adapt to different contexts.
- **Memory-Aware AI Agents** – Utilizing Qdrant DB and Neo4j Graph for persistent AI memory.
- **Document-to-Graph DB and Embeddings** – Transforming structured and unstructured data into graph-based representations.
- **Multi-Modal LLM Applications** – Integrating text, images, and other data modalities.
- **Security and Guardrails** – Implementing self-hosted models like Llama-3 or Gemma to ensure AI safety and compliance.
- **AI Agent Orchestration with LangGraph** – Managing multiple AI agents and workflows.
- **Checkpointing in LangGraph** – Ensuring fault tolerance and reproducibility in AI pipelines.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Interruptions** – Allowing human oversight in AI-driven decisions.
- **Tool Binding and API Calling** – Enabling AI agents to interact with external tools and services.
- **Autonomous vs. Controlled Workflows** – Understanding different agent workflow strategies.
- **MCP Servers** – Deploying and managing AI microservices efficiently.
- **Guardrails for AI Models** – Implementing prompt filtering, PII detection, and safety mechanisms.
- **Model Fine-Tuning** – Customizing pre-trained LLMs for specific use cases.
- **LLM as a Judge Technique** – Evaluating AI-generated responses using AI.
- **Perplexity Sonar API** – Enhancing AI reliability and accuracy.
- **Deployment on AWS** – Hosting AI applications on a scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **Cypher Query Context Retrieval** – Enhancing LLM capabilities with Neo4j Graph DB.
